# 🧩 React To-Do App Challenge

## 🚀 Implementation Notes

This React Todo App has been fixed and enhanced to include all the required functionality:

### ✅ Fixed Features

- ✓ Display a complete list of all tasks
- ✓ Fixed layout with checkboxes properly listed in a column
- ✓ Added the ability to add new tasks
- ✓ Implemented functionality to mark tasks as completed
- ✓ Added functionality to delete tasks
- ✓ Fixed the counter to accurately display completed tasks

### 🛠️ Technical Implementation

- Used React Hooks (useState, useContext, useMemo) for state management
- Implemented a clean component structure with separate components for:
  - TodoList: Main task display
  - TodoForm: For adding new tasks
  - TodoSearch: For searching tasks
  - TodoFilter: For filtering tasks by completion status
  - TodoResults: For showing task completion count
- Added proper styling with SCSS for a better user experience

```

## 📚 Future Improvements

If given more time, I would consider adding:

- Persistence using localStorage or a backend API
- Due dates and reminders
- Responsive design optimizations for mobile devices
- Better and Modern UI
